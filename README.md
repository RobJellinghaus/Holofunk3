# Holofunk3
The formerly true formerly mixed reality still looper.

## Notes on naming
It is always hard!

The meanings of some key names here:

- Viewpoint: A particular sensor that is watching the performance, running Holofunk (viewer version).
- Performer: A person wearing a HoloLens running Holofunk (performer version).
- PerformerHand: One of the performer's hands.
- Player: A particular person on the stage as seen from a particular Viewpoint.
  - Each Viewpoint identifies people separately; Player-Player correlation across Viewpoints
    is not automatic (or even implemented right now).
